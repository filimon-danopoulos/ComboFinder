# ComboFinder

This was a small project I made just for trying out node.js. The application is meant to 
help you find combos for the Magic the Gathering format EDH.

It is a mobile web app written with jQuery and Bootstrap. It runs on node.js. I originaly
wrote the webserver part aswell although I later switched to hosting it in nginx.

I have plans to hack some more on this application when I get time. Mainly I intend on
addning CSS3 animations and doing some optimizations. It is failry low priority though.

# General Warnign

The original nginx configuration of the project is lost and I am to lazy to write a new one
for a project that has just been collecting dust the last couple of months. When I see
it fit I will add the configuration so that you actually can run the app.

# License

I don't own any of artwork associated with Magic the Gathering (that's why none of it is present here).
There is a script that enables you to download all the images in the repo. 

Everything I have written is released under MIT license.
