# ComboFinder

This was a small project I made just for trying out node.js. The application is meant to 
help you find combos for the Magic the Gathering format EDH.

It is a mobile web app written with jQuery and Bootstrap. It runs on node.js. I originaly
wrote the webserver part aswell although I later switched to hosting it in nginx.

I have plans to hack some more on this application when I get time. Mainly I intend on
addning CSS3 animations and doing some optimizations. It is failry low priority though.

I don't own any of artwork associated with Magic the Gathering (that's why none of it is present here).
There is a script that enables you to download all the images in the repo.
